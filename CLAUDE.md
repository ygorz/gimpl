verified against built-in demos with blasphem.wad.

# Agent Context Boundary Policy

## Purpose
This file defines how context boundaries are managed in this project.
At the start of each new phase of work, the agent must follow the
procedure below before taking any action.

## Context Boundary Procedure
At the start of each new phase, before doing any editing or analysis:

1. Restate the current task goal in one sentence.
2. List the rules currently in effect (verbatim, not paraphrased).
3. State explicitly which prior rules are no longer in effect, if any.
4. Identify the specific artifact being worked on in this phase.
5. Then proceed with the requested work.

## Why This Matters
Rules and requirements change during long sessions. This procedure ensures
the agent is always operating from the current version of the rules, not a
prior version buried in conversation history.

## Compaction Policy
Compaction is a last resort. Proactive summarization
(`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md`) should be triggered before the
context window exceeds 60% capacity. Before any manual compaction, save the
current artifact text to its file so the current version does not depend on
the compaction summary.
